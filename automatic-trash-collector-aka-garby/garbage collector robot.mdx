title: Automatic Trash Collector aka Garby
---
The final project I worked on during my internship at TEKBOT ROBOTICS was the development of an Automatic Trash Collector, affectionately named "Garby".

### Concept and goal
This project aims to design a mobile robot capable of detecting and intercepting waste thrown in motion using lightweight embedded AI (FOMO) and an omnidirectional mecanum chassis.
Here is a sketch of the initial design:
