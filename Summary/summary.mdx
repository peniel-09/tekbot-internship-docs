title: Summary of my Internship
---
My internship at **TEKBOT Robotics** was both a human and professional learning experience.  
I had the opportunity to discover new working methods and collaborate with passionate and inspiring individuals.

I strengthened my **maker culture**, particularly through the use of:

- **CNC machines**
- **3D printers**
- **Prototyping and assembly tools**

This internship also taught me how to conduct more structured and in-depth research to precisely identify the resources needed to develop a project from start to finish.

Overall, this experience helped me grow in **autonomy**, **rigor**, and **confidence** in my ability to design and carry out a project.  
**If I had to do it again, I would definitely do so.**
