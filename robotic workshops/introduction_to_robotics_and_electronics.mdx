title: Robotics and Electronics Workshops
---

Welcome to the Robotics and Electronics Workshops section of my internship portfolio. Here, I share my experiences and thoughts as a volunteer co-facilitator of TinIMA (SCOP) workshops. These workshops are designed to introduce young people aged 8 to 18 to the fascinating world of robotics and electronics.

### Workshop Objectives
The primary goals of these workshops are to:
- Spark interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields among young participants
- Provide hands-on experience with basic robotics and electronics concepts
- Foster creativity and problem-solving skills through interactive projects like mustache robot. 

<Note> Mustache robot is an analog and interactive robot equipped with limit sensors allowing it to move in its environment while avoiding obstacles</Note>

### Workshop Structure
Each workshop is designed to be engaging and educational, typically structured as follows:
1. **Introduction**: Brief overview of robotics and electronics, including real-world applications.
2. **Hands-On Activities**: Participants work on simple projects such as building basic circuits with special kits.
3. **Discussion and Reflection**: Group discussions to share experiences, challenges faced, and lessons learned.
4. **Conclusion**: Recap of key concepts and encouragement to explore further.
