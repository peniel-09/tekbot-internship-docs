title: Drone Piloting and blockly programming workshop
---

During my internship at TEKBOT ROBOTICS, I had the opportunity to co-facilitate a workshop focused on Tello drone piloting and blocky programming using Mind pkus. This workshop was designed to introduce beginners to the exciting world of drones, combining practical flying skills with basic programming concepts.

### Workshop Objectives
The primary objectives of the workshop were to:
- Understand the basics of drone technology and its applications to african context
- Learn how to pilot a Tello drone safely and effectively
- Introduce blockly programming concepts using Mind plus to control drone movements
### Workshop Structure
The workshop was structured into several key sessions:
1. **Introduction to Drones**: Overview of drone technology, types of drones, and their applications.
2. **Tello Drone Basics**: Familiarization with the Tello drone, including its features, controls, and safety guidelines.
3. **Hands-On Piloting**: Practical sessions where participants learned to take off, land, and maneuver the Tello drone through basic flight exercises.
4. **Introduction to Blockly Programming**: Overview of block-based programming concepts using Mind plus, focusing on how to create simple programs to control the drone.
5. **Programming the Tello Drone**: Guided exercises where participants created blockly programs to perform specific drone maneuvers or to animate matrices of LED lights on the drone.
