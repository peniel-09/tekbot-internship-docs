My name is P√©niel AHOUANSOU, and I'm a Embedded Systems and IoT student at Institute for Training and Research in Computer Science of University of Abomey-Calavi (IFRI-UAC). 
I'm passionate about electronics, robotics, and programming, and it was in this context that I had the opportunity to complete my second-year internship at [TEKBOT ROBOTICS](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tekbot-robotics/) under the supervision of Mr. [Mohamed SALIFOU](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-salifou-65ab18194?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=android_app ). It's a DeepTech startup specializing in the design, development, and manufacturing of innovative robotic solutions, integrating the latest technological advances and adapted to the diverse needs of industry.
TEKBOT ROBOTICS is located within [S√®m√® City Open Park](https://www.linkedin.com/company/semecityopenpark/). S√®m√® City Open Park, commonly referred to as SCOP, is a Fablab located a few steps from S√®m√® One, opposite
the Montaigne School, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã2,500 m¬≤. 

**Main interests of my internship:**
- PCB Design (KiCad)
- Digital Fabrication (CNC Milling, 3D Printing)
- Embedded Systems & Microcontrollers
